What is the main reason to use a random forest versus a decision tree (using no more than 50 words)?
  Decision Trees are easy to interpret and generally faster to train. Random forests work well with large datasets where interpretability isn't
  a huge deal. Training time is also higher on a random forest as in it made of many trees.
How long did your random forest take to run (in seconds)?
  5 seconds
What accuracy (to two decimal places, xx.xx%) were you able to obtain?
  72.75%
